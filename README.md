# 🎮 AI-Powered Tic-Tac-Toe Game  (Task - 2)

Welcome to **Tic-Tac-Toe AI**, a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where you challenge an unbeatable AI using the **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**! 🤖🔥  

## 🚀 Features  
- 🏆 **AI Opponent (O)** – Uses Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make optimal moves.  
- 🎭 **Human Player (X)** – Enter moves manually to play against the AI.  
- 🔥 **Unbeatable AI Strategy** – The AI never loses!  
- 🎲 **Randomized Turns** – Human and AI alternate turns automatically.  
- 📜 **Clear Board Display** – Shows the current game state after every move.  
- 🏁 **Win, Lose, or Draw** – The game detects winners and announces results.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- 🐍 Python  
- 🧠 **Minimax Algorithm** – AI decision-making logic.  
- 🔄 **Alpha-Beta Pruning** – Optimizes Minimax for faster decisions.  
- 🎮 **Console-based Gameplay** – No extra dependencies required!  

## 📌 How to Play  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
